 Computer is good at cycling. It can repeat same things very fast. And programming is pretty much related to this cycling. Imagine you are a father, and not sure what you going to eat every nights. I perhaps make some dinner menu schedule and try to eat the foods every night. This is only dinner menu, but you can apply this widely.  <br>

 When you see the picture, you will see there are two variables. These are 7 days and 10 dinner menus.The two variables will run independently, and we will see computer suggests different menu everyday.

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Likewise, if you want to repeat the elements with in order, we use #.cycle <br>
#.cycle yield all the elements in the object again and again in  a loop. It you provide an integer argument, the loop will cycle that amount of times. If not, it runs forever.
#.cycle is useful when you assign same jobs again and again.
