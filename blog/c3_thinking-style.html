    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->When I took the Gregorcâ€™s quiz, the result was a little ambiguous,because my thinking style is pretty balanced except abstract sequential. Throughout the 3 weeks so far, it was pretty challenge than I expected.<br>
I have big struggles when I had to read so many articles. The word being used were sometimes hard to understand the meaning,because it is actually new field to me.So, I wished I had  more video clips or pictures at the syllabus. Filled with so many texts were sometimes made me bored. Also, technical difficulties(sometimes no one knows,why it does not work on my computer!) caused me skipped the step. Luckily it did not happened always. I somehow have done all challenges so far and I can say I quiet learned a lot from 3 weeks.</p>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->I know I have my own learning style. I like to see the examples alive. So if I do not understand clearly with text, I wish I can understand fully with more examples. I sometimes got help from very devoted peers via Google hangout, and then I fully understand the concept.<br>

Yet, the most important thing is I should accept the different type of learning style. Since the way I have learned was kind of easy way, it was not actual challenge.However,both  receiving new learning style and changing mindsets are wonderful and scary. When I see myself honestly, I pretty much have fixed mindsets rather than growth mindset.<br>

However, I can praise myself I am working on changing my mindset every single moments. Since I firmly believe that all things can be developed, everything can be worked out.</p>
