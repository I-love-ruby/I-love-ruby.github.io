Table is brain washing.

my first culture blog

10/11/14

I was the general manager of 4 Japanese restaurants in New York. I had almost 80 employees followed, great salary and accommodation was provided. The relationship with my boss was very good, and he supported my professional visa and green card. It seemed so perfect that everyone does not understand why I do not work there anymore and challenge something new to me.
While working there, I always dreamed of something I could contribute to more population with goodwill. Since I was interested in On-line education platform and I saw the potentialities, I decided to learn how to built websites.

So, Why DVC? My impression of DBC is always dark red-colored wall-block and yoga,because when I see the pics of DVC, the wall is always shown. Even though I am scary to do yoga, I like  DVC loving the idea of meditation and so on. This is far different from the others.
In order to engage myself with this type of culture, I should change myself first. I went back to my country for a while and to prepare for DVC. Today I watched Shereef's video and he expected us to have table mind set, not restaurant mindset.Simply, Shereef asked us to be a member, not a guest. With the table mindset, I will take ownership and cook,eat and share the foods( coding ) and act as one member of DVC. I will not stand behind, and I will do my best not let my peers behind of me.

I am pretty much excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I know it is tough and intense. Of course,I am little nervous whether I can finish the course successfully with my peers. Everything is up to my mind. I will continue and overcome all kind of hardships with this mindset.
Thank you!
