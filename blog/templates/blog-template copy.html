    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->When we decorate a website using CSS, we always have to use IDs and Classes to make website unique and clear. However, sometimes it could be confused when using these "naming". When we build website, we have to give a name to tags in order to distinguish among same tags.So what is the difference between them?</p>

      <p class="imgLabel" class="bcolor"><!-- Image Label Goes Here -->Simply,class is for any tags, ID is only one per page. So Id is usually used Divs or greater.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->
Simply,the difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. So, class can be appied to many other tags at the same. For example, you can make your heading text and a part of your paragraph in body section with same color or same style using class. It is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section.Therefore class is for applying your style to a group of elements. ID styles apply to just the element with that ID.Make sense?
