    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Asking question is the one of the shortcut to learn how to code. Some people really shy about asking question to someone never met before,it actually can help a lot. Sometimes I spend more than an hour to research,and still do not get it. But when you ask to many people through google + and so on, someone usually has the idea and answers for it.

Once I asked myself how I should ask questions to someone I never met. I researched  it (from wikiHow) and want to introduce it to you.<br>

1.Explain my understanding.I have to give an excuse as to "how you got confused". This does not need to be true but should hide the fact that you might not have been paying the closest attention.<br>
2.State what I know and what I don’t know. State something that you do understand about the topic. This will show that you understand something about it and make you sound smarter.<br>
3.Use specific language.Try to be as specific as you can and use specific language.<br>
4.If possible,visualize it.<br>
4.Ask politely and keep the question simple.<br>
5.If I do not received any answer, ask again.<br>
6.Check the answer.<br>
7.Appreciate.<br>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->To me, when I ask a question, I always try to explain clearly with screenshot. I heard that people understand better when visualized. I always took screenshot of my error and tried to explain the error and my questions, I could get the answers always. Also, when I got the answer I never forget to say “Thank you!”.
