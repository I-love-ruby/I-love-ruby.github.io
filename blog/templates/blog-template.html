    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Arrays and Hashes are very important to understand computer languages.Arrays and hashes are indexed collections and they store collections of objects, accessible using a key. The biggest difference between arrays and hashes is that hashes can use any type object(strings,numbers..) as a key to access the value, but arrays only use integers to access. Therefore, array is used to store a list of values in a single variable. Suppose that you are deal with studentsâ€™ scores.  Hashes are just collections of key-value pairs, where a unique key is associated with some values.Simply it is value-pair.</p>

Array is used when you search something quickly. Since all objects have own index number, it is very quick to call an object using the index number. Since hash can use any objects as a key to access values, we can use hash under this circumstances.
