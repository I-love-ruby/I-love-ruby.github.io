    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your city is an instance of the class of objects known as cities.<br>

Take the example of any city. The city has population, average incomes, crime rates. These characteristics form the data members of the class State. You can differentiate one city from the other with the help of these characteristics.<br>

A State can also have certain functions, such as education, making jobs, and providing civil services. Even these functions form the data members of the class State. You can, therefore, define a class as a combination of characteristics and functions.<br>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Ruby provides four types of variables:
1.Local Variables: Local variables are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available outside the method. <br>
2.Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object.<br>
3.Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class.<br>
4.Global Variables: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable.
