It has been widely believed that no matter what technology is simply good. It absolutely make us very much convenient and comfortable. It has provided enormous benefits to the world. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.</p>

However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons. Furthermore, internet has given a lot of benefits to human society, but also it is not always completely safe, either. When you read Googleâ€™s privacy policy carefully, it is clear that they retain the right to make significant decisions about our data without regard for our interests. With the new movement to store everything on the cloud, who knows if a single hacker would be able to take down entire chunks of the internet. As our economy becomes more dependent on bits than atoms, how will we protect these resources from being damaged or devalued by hackers?

In conclusion, modern technologies can very well be a double-edged sword, from safety to connectedness. They do have their advantages, but as with many revolutionary inventions, they can radically change our lives, for better or worse.So, as much as we do our best to make profits and better,we also have to do our best to protect our privacy and so on. Make future IT student have resposibility through education and Goverments and IT industry must do their best to protect privacy.
