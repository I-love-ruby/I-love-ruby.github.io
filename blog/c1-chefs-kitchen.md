Table is brain washing.

my first culture blog

10/11/14

I was the general manager of 4 Japanese restaurants in New York. I had almost 80 employees followed, great salary, accommodation was provided. The relationship with my boss was very good and he supported my professional visa and green card. So everyone around me does not undestand why I do not work there anymore.
When I managed restaurant, I always felt the job should not be the last job in my life. I am still young and smart enough to like math and physics.The restaurant job was still pretty good and very worth to do so,because I had to care all the employees and their family member. It was really worthwhile to do so. However, I wanted to do something more creative jobs and my counclusion was, putting myself into IT industy.
I can say myself I have been interested in Web developing. I was the first one who built my own website in my school using a text editor in 1996. I could not forget the precious memory I spent whole night for building my website.Therefore I decided to study web development with DVC.
So, Why DVC? My impression of DBC is always dark red-colored wall-block and yoga,because when I see the pics of DVC, the wall is always shown. Even though I am scary to do yoga, I like  DVC loving the idea of meditation and so on. This is far different from the others.
In order to engage myself with this type of culture, I should change myself.  Since I was a general manager, sometimes my staffs were afraid of me. I did my best not to be such a manager, but I found myself smiled awkwardly. So, I went back to my country for six months to get back my cute smile :) and to prepare for DVC. Simply, Shereef expected us to have table mind set, not restaurant mindset. With the table mindset, I will take ownership and cook,eat and share the foods( coding ) and act as one member of DVC. I will not stand behind, and I will do my best not let my peers behind of me.
I am pretty much excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I know it is tough and intense. Of course,I am little nervous whether I can finish the course successfully with my peers. Everything is up to my mind. I will continue and overcome all kind of hardships with this mindset.
Thank you!
