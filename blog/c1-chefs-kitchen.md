Table is brain washing.

my first culture blog

10/11/14

I was the general manager of 4 Japanese restaurants in New York. I had almost 80 employees followed, great salary, accommodation was provided. The relationship with my boss was very good and he supported my professional visa and green card. It seemed so perfect that everyone does not undestand why I do not work there anymore.
While working there, I always felt the job should not be the last job in my life. My responsiblity was very important,because taking care of all the employees and their family member is pretty worthwhile to do so. The money you spend for a piece of sushi can make children go to school.However, I wanted to do something more creative jobs before I got order and my counclusion was, putting myself into IT industy.

So, Why DVC? My impression of DBC is always dark red-colored wall-block and yoga,because when I see the pics of DVC, the wall is always shown. Even though I am scary to do yoga, I like  DVC loving the idea of meditation and so on. This is far different from the others.

in order to engage myself with this type of culture, I should change myself.  Since I was a general manager, sometimes my staffs were afraid of me. I did my best not to be such a manager, but I found myself smiled awkwardly. So, I went back to my country for six months to get back my cute smile :) and to prepare for DVC. Simply, Shereef expected us to have table mind set, not restaurant mindset. With the table mindset, I will take ownership and cook,eat and share the foods( coding ) and act as one member of DVC. I will not stand behind, and I will do my best not let my peers behind of me.

I am pretty much excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. I know it is tough and intense. Of course,I am little nervous whether I can finish the course successfully with my peers. Everything is up to my mind. I will continue and overcome all kind of hardships with this mindset.
Thank you!
