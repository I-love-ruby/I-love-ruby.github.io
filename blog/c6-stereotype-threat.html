    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->Luckily I never experience any kind of stereotype threat in my life seriously. When I watched Claude M.Steele,”Identity and stereotype threat”, I was so surprised that he was able to use swimming poor only wednesday evening because he is a black.I thought that could happened maybe in 2-300 years ago. Perhaps I have lived only in New York,which is so-called “melting pot”, I never experienced so  badly because of my race or my appearance. Also I was a student of Baruch College which is the most diversity college in U.S,and I worked at Japanese restaurants as manager where many employees are Asian.
  But I understand when I work at IT industry, the surrounding is going to be more dynamic and more diverse. Stereotype is not only about racism. It could be about gender,heights,appearance or English accent. I know the world is not always my side, so these stereotype I may experience someday whether I recognize or not. However, my understanding is that I wanna be the person whom people need. I several times experience when I work at the restaurant, people judge my many factors in the beginning. However, once he or she showed the authenticity and passion,no one blamed anymore. Therefore,I will do my best to be a good co-worker in which people can trust.Then I would not have any serious problem because I am an Asian or so on.</p>

However, If I experienced such a stereotype, I may stand honestly and try to find what I can do personally.I do not wanna speak up and make a trouble for my company. If the stereotype is obvious, then I will ask my manager or mentor how to deal with and try to solve it nicer way.From my working history what I have learned is that you don’t have to worry about the others point of view and try to get closer first.
