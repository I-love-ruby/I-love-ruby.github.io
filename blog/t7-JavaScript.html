    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> These two languages,Ruby and Javascript are similar. Once you are well on one side of language, you may learn the others so quickly.
Here,I would like to simply compare the differences between Ruby and Javascript.It will be helpful to understand the two different language.
The one thing what I do not like from Javascript is that JS syntax is pretty complex compared to Ruby. Because Ruby syntax is simple and easy to read and understand. In terms of speed, it is widely believed that JS is faster than Ruby.</p>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->In JavaScript, when a variable is passed to a function with the same variable name, the value of the variable will be altered. In order to avoid these changes, the user has to explicitly fix the variable name. on the other hand in Ruby, when a variable is passed to a method with the same variable name, no changes will be made to the value of the variable. To me, the biggest different is about functions. For example, Ruby has blocks,prods and lambdas to perform supple and dynamic functional programming,but only one function is JS. But In JS, few rapid functions can be included to JS library, so as to achieve a similar dynamic programming functionality as in Ruby.
