    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->When I took the Gregorc’s quiz, the result was a little ambiguous,because my thinking style is pretty balanced except abstract sequential. Throughout the 3 weeks so far, it was pretty challenge than I expected.<br>
I have big struggles when I had to read so many articles. The word being used were sometimes hard to understand the meaning,because it is actually new field to me.So, I wished I had  more video clips or pictures at the syllabus. Filled with so many texts were sometimes made me bored. Also, technical difficulties(sometimes no one knows,why it does not work on my computer!) caused me skipped the step. Luckily it did not happened always. I somehow have done all challenges so far and I can say I quiet learned a lot from 3 weeks.</p>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->I know I have my own learning style. I like to see the examples alive. So if I do not understand clearly with text, I wish I can understand fully with more examples. I sometimes got help from very devoted peers via Google hangout, and then I fully understand the concept.<br>

Yet, the most important thing is I should accept the different type of learning style. Since the way I have learned was kind of easy way, it was not actual challenge.However,both  receiving new learning style and changing mindsets are wonderful and scary. When I see myself honestly, I pretty much have fixed mindsets rather than growth mindset.<br>

However, I can praise myself I am working on changing my mindset every single moments. Since I firmly believe that all things can be developed, everything can be worked out.</p>

    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Pairing is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One is  driver who write codes and  another is navigator who reviews each line of code as it is typed in. As a student,we often switch the role between driver and navigator. I several times paired with our peers and  experienced so many things from them.I often learn and ask questions why,and it simply saves my time and efforts. Therefore, I can say I learned a lot from pairing.Having said that, I might lose something while paring.

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->I am afraid that I can not contribute to anything for the coding work.I sometimes do pair with such a great peer. They are skillful and know how to do without any hesitate. It sometimes kill my confidence. However, when I see how much they are passionate, I must admit that I have to work harder.
However, it is absolutely great. Good things about pairing is happiness when I and my partner finish a hard challenges. They happiness can not be explain especially when we solve a difficult question.

    <h4 class="bcolor"><!-- Post Title Goes Here-->Stereotype?</h4>
    <h6 class="bcolor"><!-- Date Goes Here -->November 2, 2014</h6>
    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->Luckily I never experience any kind of stereotype threat in my life seriously. When I watched Claude M.Steele,”Identity and stereotype threat”, I was so surprised that he was able to use swimming poor only wednesday evening because he is a black.I thought that could happened maybe in 2-300 years ago. Perhaps I have lived only in New York,which is so-called “melting pot”, I never experienced so  badly because of my race or my appearance. Also I was a student of Baruch College which is the most diversity college in U.S,and I worked at Japanese restaurants as manager where many employees are Asian.
  But I understand when I work at IT industry, the surrounding is going to be more dynamic and more diverse. Stereotype is not only about racism. It could be about gender,heights,appearance or English accent. I know the world is not always my side, so these stereotype I may experience someday whether I recognize or not. However, my understanding is that I wanna be the person whom people need. I several times experience when I work at the restaurant, people judge my many factors in the beginning. However, once he or she showed the authenticity and passion,no one blamed anymore. Therefore,I will do my best to be a good co-worker in which people can trust.Then I would not have any serious problem because I am an Asian or so on.</p>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->
However, If I experienced such a stereotype, I may stand honestly and try to find what I can do personally.I do not wanna speak up and make a trouble for my company. If the stereotype is obvious, then I will ask my manager or mentor how to deal with and try to solve it nicer way.From my working history what I have learned is that you don’t have to worry about the others point of view and try to get closer first.

<strong>my most important value; Achievement</strong>
It was not so many, but I certainly I have great moments in my life.
To me, when I come to New York, I had three goals I have to achieve;Obtaining a B.B.A degree,green card and saving some money for my family. Every time when I get closer and the day I achieve it,I really admired and proud of myself. The only one thing I can say my friends and neighbors is that I have achieved several things while people inherited something. Sometimes, people may  be sarcastic about my achievement because it is not so big and great. But I think that achieving something definitely make myself more can-do-person.

<strong>My advice to someone</strong>
Someone asked for my advice was achievement. I already achieved somethings that people want to,she asked me how. I gave her some of my advice for an hour using Skype.Main point was I never gave up and tried to be loyal to my job. I was happy I could help her.
<hr>
<strong>values and stereotype </strong>

To me, I sometimes judge people from their appearance,but their race or gender. However, the way I judge people is how they have lived or what they achieved for their dream.It does not matter how much he or she is rich.Even you are so rich and everything is inherited, then I do not value the person, but if he or she is still struggling to achieve something for better future,I deeply value the person. I think it is fair to understand and figure the person fairly.

    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Arrays and Hashes are very important to understand computer languages.Arrays and hashes are indexed collections and they store collections of objects, accessible using a key. The biggest difference between arrays and hashes is that hashes can use any type object(strings,numbers..) as a key to access the value, but arrays only use integers to access. Therefore, array is used to store a list of values in a single variable. Suppose that you are deal with students’ scores.  Hashes are just collections of key-value pairs, where a unique key is associated with some values.Simply it is value-pair.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Then when should I use arrays? Or vice versa.
Array is used when you search something quickly. Since all objects have own index number, it is very quick to call an object using the index number. Since hash can use any objects as a key to access values, we can use hash under this circumstances.

    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Asking question is the one of the shortcut to learn how to code. Some people really shy about asking question to someone never met before,it actually can help a lot. Sometimes I spend more than an hour to research,and still do not get it. But when you ask to many people through google + and so on, someone usually has the idea and answers for it.

Once I asked myself how I should ask questions to someone I never met. I researched  it (from wikiHow) and want to introduce it to you.<br>

1.Explain my understanding.I have to give an excuse as to "how you got confused". This does not need to be true but should hide the fact that you might not have been paying the closest attention.<br>
2.State what I know and what I don’t know. State something that you do understand about the topic. This will show that you understand something about it and make you sound smarter.<br>
3.Use specific language.Try to be as specific as you can and use specific language.<br>
4.If possible,visualize it.<br>
4.Ask politely and keep the question simple.<br>
5.If I do not received any answer, ask again.<br>
6.Check the answer.<br>
7.Appreciate.<br>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->To me, when I ask a question, I always try to explain clearly with screenshot. I heard that people understand better when visualized. I always took screenshot of my error and tried to explain the error and my questions, I could get the answers always. Also, when I got the answer I never forget to say “Thank you!”.
