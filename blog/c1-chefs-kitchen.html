    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->Emotional conflicts are happened every moments in any situation,because everyone has difference value,idea and circumstances.To me, I often experienced this emotional conflicts, but I always try to surpass it with easy way. When I was a manager of restaurant, I had hundred customers and dozens of employees. The job was pretty tough, because I was a key person to solve this conflicts happened in the restaurants.Also the job was pretty stressful, I also find a way to release the stress. Usually my emotional conflict happened when I see one of my staff was not responsible for his or her job and act like uncommon.For example, someone was late on work, I suppose the person has to say “I’m sorry,I am late!”. If not, my emotional conflict started. for example,“Do I have to tell the person to say sorry”? or “Do I have to act like nothing happened?” So, in the beginning, I try to not say anything to avoid the situation.

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->However, is it really good idea to run or avoid conflict situation? Perhaps if is is serious,come down and it is better to find a peaceful way to solve it.  According to my experience I felt I lose credit from the majority of employees .Also, it is not good to fly off the handle later. If happens I may lose a good worker. Therefore, I learned how to deal with people in business as manager.I suppose managers have to share his or her own idea with staffs as always and persuade them. Then it makes much better outputs in real.So I try to deal with people  with more confidence, sincerity and open-minded.
