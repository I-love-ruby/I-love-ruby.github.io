1. Imagine you are drawing something on paper, you  always feel you need to fix or erase some part of your drawing. If you are a graphic designer, you definetely want to keep the original files and layouts of all versions.So you can go back to the beginning, track the process, and recover any mistakes. VCS( version control system) is like this.<br>
There are 3 kinds of VCS; 1.local version control system 2.Centralized version control 3.Distributed version control system. To begin with, local version control system is simply,you just store all the data into your laptop computer. It is simple,convienient,and generally being used by most of people.But it is risky when your local computer is broken and caused a lot of errors and mistakes. You can overwrite new files to old ones by chance.<br>
Another problem is people,or developers want to work together.Local version control system can not help out this cooperation, Centralized Version Control was made. Also simply I can explain that this CVC is two computers with one server. This provides a lot of benefits to develpers,because server master can control the projects and developers are able to check and compare the project each others. However, if the server or hard drive containing a lot of data is broken, it still cause a lot of problems again.
Therefore, distributed version control system (DVCS) is finally invented. Here, user do not have to download recent snapshot. They simply copy the repositories into there local repository. Therefore, when the server is down, still users can work together and even recover the server. you can back-up all the data when checkout.Githup support this DVS to its users.<br>

2. git has three stages. 1) working dir 2) index 3)head. When you track your changes, it is very useful you put tags by typing  "$ git tag". Then you can see the version 1.0.0.  If you have to go back to previous,use $ git checkout -- (filename)
<br>
3. Before Github made, many or most of companies create their codes and knowledge in private under the name of copyright. When you access Github, you are free to download any code sources and develop entire industry with permission when repos made.Now it becomes the largest online storage space collaborative working space on earth. Of course, it contains a lot of knowledge and information for everyone.FREE!

    <h4 class="bcolor"><!-- Post Title Goes Here-->What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h4>
    <h6 class="bcolor"><!-- Date Goes Here -->October 18, 2014</h6>
    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->When we decorate a website using CSS, we always have to use IDs and Classes to make website unique and clear. However, sometimes it could be confused when using these "naming". When we build website, we have to give a name to tags in order to distinguish among same tags.So what is the difference between them?</p>
    <div class="imageBox" class="bcolor">
      <img src="imgs/tech2.png" class="bcolor">
      <p class="imgLabel" class="bcolor"><!-- Image Label Goes Here -->Simply,class is for any tags, ID is only one per page. So Id is usually used Divs or greater.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->
Simply,the difference between the two is that while a class can be used repeatedly on a page, an ID must only be used once per page. So, class can be appied to many other tags at the same. For example, you can make your heading text and a part of your paragraph in body section with same color or same style using class. It is appropriate to use an ID on the div element that is marking up the main content on the page, as there will only be one main content section.Therefore class is for applying your style to a group of elements. ID styles apply to just the element with that ID.Make sense?

    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Arrays and Hashes are very important to understand computer languages.Arrays and hashes are indexed collections and they store collections of objects, accessible using a key. The biggest difference between arrays and hashes is that hashes can use any type object(strings,numbers..) as a key to access the value, but arrays only use integers to access. Therefore, array is used to store a list of values in a single variable. Suppose that you are deal with students’ scores.  Hashes are just collections of key-value pairs, where a unique key is associated with some values.Simply it is value-pair.</p>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Then when should I use arrays? Or vice versa.
Array is used when you search something quickly. Since all objects have own index number, it is very quick to call an object using the index number.Hash is unlike an array in that the stored variables are not stored in any particular order, and they are retrieved with a "key" instead of by their position in the collection.

 Computer is good at cycling. It can repeat same things very fast. And programming is pretty much related to this cycling. Imagine you are a father, and not sure what you going to eat every nights. I perhaps make some dinner menu schedule and try to eat the foods every night. This is only dinner menu, but you can apply this widely.  <br>

 When you see the picture, you will see there are two variables. These are 7 days and 10 dinner menus.The two variables will run independently, and we will see computer suggests different menu everyday.

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Likewise, if you want to repeat the elements with in order, we use #.cycle <br>
#.cycle yield all the elements in the object again and again in  a loop. It you provide an integer argument, the loop will cycle that amount of times. If not, it runs forever.
#.cycle is useful when you assign same jobs again and again.

    <h6 class="bcolor"><!-- Date Goes Here -->November 7, 2014</h6>
    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here -->A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In object-oriented terms, we say that your city is an instance of the class of objects known as cities.<br>

Take the example of any city. The city has population, average incomes, crime rates. These characteristics form the data members of the class State. You can differentiate one city from the other with the help of these characteristics.<br>

A State can also have certain functions, such as education, making jobs, and providing civil services. Even these functions form the data members of the class State. You can, therefore, define a class as a combination of characteristics and functions.<br>

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->Ruby provides four types of variables:
1.Local Variables: Local variables are the variables that are defined in a method. Local variables are not available outside the method. <br>
2.Instance Variables: Instance variables are available across methods for any particular instance or object. That means that instance variables change from object to object.<br>
3.Class Variables: Class variables are available across different objects. A class variable belongs to the class and is a characteristic of a class.<br>
4.Global Variables: Class variables are not available across classes. If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable.

    <h4 class="bcolor"><!-- Post Title Goes Here-->Object Oriented VS Functional </h4>
    <h6 class="bcolor"><!-- Date Goes Here -->November 16, 2014</h6>
    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> In object oriented programming  almost everything is an object that can be modified and that can perform tasks. for example, you might have an object that models a bicycle, from above the bicycle can be modified, you may be able to change the color of the bicycle. It can also perform tasks (i.e. it also has behavior) for example the bicycle can
run fast, or carry stuffs. As an object it is bundled neatly in a package
that provides methods to change the state of the bicycle, and to make the
bicycle perform actions. This package is usually called a module, in
addition to the methods used to change state, and perform actions, the
module also has data that is used to store any state information
needed.Because this module is a complete package that models your object
competely, the module can easily be reused in many different
applications. Once it is wirtten and working anyone should be able to
use the module without fully understanding internals.

In functional programming what you have basically are a set of
functions each of which performs a task. Selectively executing these
function results in the solution to the problem at hand.

For example, you might have a function that takes the coords. of a
square computes the area, and you may have another function that
computes the area of a triangle. By executing the square function 6
times you could compute the area of a cube. Or by executing a
combination of the square and triangle functions you could compute the
area of a rhomboid. As you can see you can build quite complex systems
based on simple functions.<br>

So simply OOP makes it easier to conceive very large
complex systems. Because it gives the developers the ability to break
the system down to small tangible.
In a functional paradigm what invariably happens as a large system
grows: it becomes a huge pile of functions. All of which are
interconnected, and dependent on each other.

    <h4 class="bcolor"><!-- Post Title Goes Here-->Ruby VS Javascript</h4>
    <h6 class="bcolor"><!-- Date Goes Here -->November 23, 2014</h6>
    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> These two languages,Ruby and Javascript are similar. Once you are well on one side of language, you may learn the others so quickly.
Here,I would like to simply compare the differences between Ruby and Javascript.It will be helpful to understand the two different language.
The one thing what I do not like from Javascript is that JS syntax is pretty complex compared to Ruby. Because Ruby syntax is simple and easy to read and understand. In terms of speed, it is widely believed that JS is faster than Ruby.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->In JavaScript, when a variable is passed to a function with the same variable name, the value of the variable will be altered. In order to avoid these changes, the user has to explicitly fix the variable name. on the other hand in Ruby, when a variable is passed to a method with the same variable name, no changes will be made to the value of the variable. To me, the biggest different is about functions. For example, Ruby has blocks,prods and lambdas to perform supple and dynamic functional programming,but only one function is JS. But In JS, few rapid functions can be included to JS library, so as to achieve a similar dynamic programming functionality as in Ruby.
