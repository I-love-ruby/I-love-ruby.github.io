    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> In object oriented programming  almost everything is an object that can be modified and that can perform tasks. for example, you might have an object that models a bicycle, from above the bicycle can be modified, you may be able to change the color of the bicycle. It can also perform tasks (i.e. it also has behavior) for example the bicycle can
run fast, or carry stuffs. As an object it is bundled neatly in a package
that provides methods to change the state of the bicycle, and to make the
bicycle perform actions. This package is usually called a module, in
addition to the methods used to change state, and perform actions, the
module also has data that is used to store any state information
needed.Because this module is a complete package that models your object
competely, the module can easily be reused in many different
applications. Once it is wirtten and working anyone should be able to
use the module without fully understanding internals.

In functional programming what you have basically are a set of
functions each of which performs a task. Selectively executing these
function results in the solution to the problem at hand.

For example, you might have a function that takes the coords. of a
square computes the area, and you may have another function that
computes the area of a triangle. By executing the square function 6
times you could compute the area of a cube. Or by executing a
combination of the square and triangle functions you could compute the
area of a rhomboid. As you can see you can build quite complex systems
based on simple functions.<br>

So simply OOP makes it easier to conceive very large
complex systems. Because it gives the developers the ability to break
the system down to small tangible.
In a functional paradigm what invariably happens as a large system
grows: it becomes a huge pile of functions. All of which are
interconnected, and dependent on each other.
