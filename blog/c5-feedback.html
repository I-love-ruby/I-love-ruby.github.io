    <p class="blogPara"class="bcolor"><!-- text goes here --> Pairing is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One is  driver who write codes and  another is navigator who reviews each line of code as it is typed in. As a student,we often switch the role between driver and navigator. I several times paired with our peers and  experienced so many things from them.I often learn and ask questions why,and it simply saves my time and efforts. Therefore, I can say I learned a lot from pairing.Having said that, I might lose something while paring.

    <p class="blogPara" class="bcolor"><!-- Second Paragraph Goes Here -->I am afraid that I can not contribute to anything for the coding work.I sometimes do pair with such a great peer. They are skillful and know how to do without any hesitate. It sometimes kill my confidence. However, when I see how much they are passionate, I must admit that I have to work harder.
However, it is absolutely great. Good things about pairing is happiness when I and my partner finish a hard challenges. They happiness can not be explain especially when we solve a difficult question.
